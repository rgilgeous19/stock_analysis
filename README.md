# **ANALYSIS OF RESULTS**


## _Overview of Project_

    The purpose of this project is to analyze stock data for Steve's 
    parents, so they would be able to make a sensible decision of 
    which stocks to invest in. His parents initially wanted to invest in
    one stock, but Steve advised them not to put all their eggs in 
    one basket. This project finds the total daily
    volume and yearly return for each stock for the years 2017 and 
    2018, so Steve's parents would be able to choose the stocks that would
    give them the maximum return.
