# **ANALYSIS OF RESULTS**


## _Overview of Project_

    The purpose of this project is to analyze stock data, using VBA, for Steve's 
    parents, so they would be able to make a sensible decision of 
    which stocks to invest in. His parents initially wanted to invest in
    one stock, but Steve advised them not to put all their eggs in 
    one basket. This project finds the total daily
    volume and yearly return for each stock for the years 2017 and 
    2018, so Steve's parents would be able to choose the stocks that would
    give them the maximum return.
    
    
## _Results_

- ### ***2017 Analysis***
            
         In 2017, DQ stock had the highest return rate of 199.45% with a total
         daily volume of 35,796,200. However, TERP stock had the lowest
         return rate of -7.21% with a total daily volume of 139,402,800.
         From this information, we can infer that the price of the DQ stock ha 
         been rapidly increasing over the year, while the price of TERP had
         been on the decline. 
  
- ### ***2018 Analysis***

          In 2018, most of the stocks had a negative return rate except for 
          ENPH with a return rate of 81.92% and RUN with a return rate of 83.95%.
          Since most of the stocks were in the "red", we can assume that there
          might have been something external, like inflation or current world events,
          affecting the stock market.
          
          
          
          Based on the stock data analyzed in 2017 and 2018, I would advise Steve's 
          parents to invest in ENPH, RUN and SEDG. ENPH and RUN stocks had positive 
          returns in both years, and specifically in 2018 when all other stocks were
          on the decline. This shows the resilience from the external impacts of the 
          stock market. They should also invest in SEDG because they had a great return 
          of 184.5% in 2017. Even though they had -7.8% return in 2018, the negative 
          return rate is small compared to the return rate in 2017.
